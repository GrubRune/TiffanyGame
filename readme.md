Ahmed wants to go to school (+18)

This game is more of a statement than a game that is supposed to be fun.
Its target is to raise awareness and inform about how the so called precise war drones used
in the modern war against terrorism. Against the statements of politicians and the army -
they in fact DO cause terrible collateral damages.

Controlled by modern soldiers away from the actual battlefield - killing is made too easy.
Lives loose their value by increasing the distances between offender and victim
- this is scientifically proven.

The setting is taken from reports of real victims living in towns watched by drones.
The drones fly over their houses every day and observe - fully armed and ready to kill.
You never know if you will become one of a drones victim just because you are
at the wrong place, at a wrong time.

What do we do now?
Not only a question the people living in these villages ask them selves every day, but
also to humanity: Do we want to live in a world - where a government can take out people
everywhere on the planet without even have to give away informations about these actions?
